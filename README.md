### Project Description
PoetNav is a delightfully confusing navigation system that gives you directions‚Ä¶ that make absolutely no sense.
Instead of telling you to ‚ÄúTurn left in 200 meters‚Äù, it might say:
‚ÄúWalk until the breeze feels right, then trust your instincts.‚Äù
‚ÄúTake a sharp turn when you see a cat that reminds you of childhood.‚Äù

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern GPS systems are too accurate, too reliable, and far too helpful.
They tell you exactly where to go, when to turn, and how long it‚Äôll take ‚Äî
leaving no room for imagination, self-discovery, or accidental adventure.
Where‚Äôs the thrill of wandering aimlessly?
Where‚Äôs the poetic guidance from the universe?
What if you want to get lost emotionally, spiritually, and geographically?

Clearly, the world has been suffering from directional over-efficiency.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing PoetNav ‚Äî the first and only navigation system that replaces real directions with poetic nonsense, cosmic suggestions, and pure chaotic vibes.

Instead of solving your problem, it elevates your confusion to an art form.
Why follow logic when you can follow intuition, sarcasm, and metaphors?

Starting the Journey: The user selects a trip from Thiruvananthapuram to Varkala
Step-by-Step Riddles: The GPS breaks the trip into ‚Äústeps,‚Äù each one written in cryptic poetic language (e.g., ‚ÄúFrom the eternal serpent‚Äôs golden city‚Ä¶ begin your mystical journey‚Ä¶‚Äù).
Distance and ETA: The app still shows a realistic distance (e.g., 585 km) and estimated time (e.g., 108 minutes), giving it the illusion of functionality.
Text-to-Speech Feature: Users can hear the poetic directions using the ‚ÄúSpeak‚Äù button, enhancing the whimsical experience.
Progress View: A list of all poetic steps is visible in a collapsible journey log, adding to the narrative-style navigation.
